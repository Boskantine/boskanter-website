We appreciate your efforts to use public transport or ride the bike.  
You’ll be more mobile if you travel by backpack (rather than trailer) because there are some sand roads.

# By bike
Maybe you want to follow the ‘Mijnwerkerspad’ (“miner’s path” in Dutch): this is an old railway embankment between Zottegem and Ronse, turned into a GR bicycle path. But be careful, the path is interrupted in Opbrakel. Coming from Ronse, it’s better to turn left at Hurdumont. Coming from Zottegem, you turn right at the interruption. If you want to follow the ‘fietsknooppunten’ (a network of fixed cycling routes between several points), we are between points 48 and 99.

# By train
You can reach us by bus (see next chapter) from the trainstations of Ronse and Zottegem. You can reach Brakel (4.5 km from Boskanter) also by bus from the trainstations of Geraardsbergen and Oudenaarde. Zottegem, Geraardsbergen and Oudenaarde can be reached by a direct train from Brussels every hour. 
For travel direction, check [the website of the NMBS](https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/travel-info/current/current-departure-times). 
If you come by train from the border of Belgium, and you are younger than 27, [this ticket](https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/tickets-and-railcards/gopass1) could be the cheaper one. You have to buy it on-line. 
If you plan to make at least ten trips in Belgium, [this](https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/tickets-and-railcards/gopass10) might be the cheapest option if you’re under 27 and [this](https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/tickets-and-railcards/railpass) if you are older. 
A trainticket in Belgium is valid for a certain day, not for a certain time. We don’t have a reservation system on our trains. 
When you travel to or from Burssels Airport, you have to pay a supplement for the train. You can avoid this by taking a bus to Brussels (see next chapter).

# By bus
There is a busstop at 10 to 15 min. walking from Boskanter. 
It’s easiest to reach us by bus from the train stations of Ronse and Zottegem. From these train stations, you can use bus 20 and busses 207 and 208.

    During the week they drive from
        Zottegem from 6h21 till 20h21 (till 21.21 only to Brakel centre),
        Ronse from 6.00 till 20.30
    on saturday they drive from
        Zottegem from 7.45 till 19.56 (till 21.51 only to Brakel centre),
        Ronse from 7.28 till 19.37
    and on Sunday from
        Zottegem from 8h51 till 18h51
        Ronse from 8.33 till 18.30

You  can find the timetables for these busses [on the website of De Lijn](https://www.delijn.be/en/). You have to press a button on the bus, to ask the driver to stop. Check for the stop on your route planner, or ask the bus driver beforehand to warn you. 
Tickets can be bought on-line, even just before you get on the bus. The cheaper option is a ticket for ten rides that you can buy either on-line or in the trainstation or newspaper shops. We can take over remaining rides on the paper ticket if you would not use all of them. 
On the map below, tou can follow the dotted blue line to get from the circle (busstop) to the arrow (Boskanter). You should count 10 minutes. Watch out: part of the road is a small dirt track. Very beautifull, but not made for trailers.

# GPS
Aim for the crossroads between Pullem and Koningsweg instead of ‘Koningsweg 1’. Because Koningsweg consists of two parts with a forest in between and the GPS can send you to the wrong end.
