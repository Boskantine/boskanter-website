# Directions
We appreciate your efforts to use public transport or ride the bike.  
You’ll be more mobile if you travel by backpack (rather than trailer).

## By bike
Maybe you want to follow the ‘Mijnwerkerspad’ (“miner’s path” in Dutch): this is an old railway embankment between Zottegem and Ronse, turned into a GR bicycle path. But be careful, the path is interrupted in Opbrakel. Coming from Ronse, it’s better to turn left at Hurdumont. Coming from Zottegem, you turn right at the interruption. If you want to follow the ‘fietsknooppunten’ (a network of fixed cycling routes between several points), we are between points 48 and 99.

## By train
You can reach us by bus (see next chapter) from the trainstations of Ronse and Zottegem. You can reach Brakel (4.5 km from Boskanter) also by bus from the trainstations of Geraardsbergen and Oudenaarde. Zottegem, Geraardsbergen and Oudenaarde can be reached by a direct train from Brussels every hour. 
For travel direction, check [the website of the NMBS](https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/travel-info/current/current-departure-times). 
If you come by train from the border of Belgium, and you are younger than 27, [this ticket](https://www.belgiantrain.be/en/tickets-and-railcards/gopass1) could be the cheaper one. You have to buy it on-line. 
If you plan to make at least ten trips in Belgium, this might be the cheapest option if you’re under 27 and this if you are older. 
A trainticket in Belgium is valid for a certain day, not for a certain time. We don’t have a reservation system on our trains. 
When you travel to or from Burssels Airport, you have to pay a supplement for the train. You can avoid this by taking a bus to Brussels (see next chapter).
