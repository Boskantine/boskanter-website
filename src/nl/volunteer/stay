permaculture farm in Brakel, Belgium, with garden, animals and kids

# ABOUT US 
"Taste a different life."

We run a small educational non-profit organization with a permaculture farm. We offer people the chance to experience a simple life in connection with nature. We hope this will inspire and motivate people to become less dependent on ending resources.
Approximately every two weeks, we make sourdough bread in our wood-fired masonry oven.
We organise activities for the neighbourhood such as a pizza-party, at which we share our harvest and our bread and other products. Sometimes we organise crafts evenings.
In the permaculture garden, we try to build up fertile soil with organic material from the surrounding. Recent years have been very challenging due to te drought. We try to grow most of the vegetables we eat, which means the cook must be creative from time to time. Surplus vegetables and fruits are brought to Poverello Ronse, where volunteers cook free meals for the poor.
The place is gradually built out by the volunteers, using low-tech ecological building techniques such as rocket-stove, clay from the land, wood from the forest, and homemade paint based on fresh cheese and flour (next to more traditional materials).
The project is ran by the owners of the place (Ine, Dirk, Hazel (15) and Sienna (13)), sometimes helped by some long-term volunteers. Roxanne and Wout join the project for this year and live in their wagon.
The 4 ha domain has forest, orchard (meadow), and agricultural land. There are sheep, dogs, cats, chickens, and an old horse.

# HELP NEEDED 
We have garden- and construction work in the pipeline, and we make time for practising crafts. For the moment (sumer 2025) we have one Italian and one Portugese long term volunteer. We plan most of the sumer work in August, so we still have place for people that come at least three weeks between July 20th and the end of September. 

We can host some 'long term' volunteers. Long term volunteers stay (after a mutual try-out period) several months and help manage the farm and the short term volunteers. They are more involved in the planning, organisation and decision making. They can learn skills that need more time to master, such as baking sourdough bread in the wood-oven, making willow baskets, repairing bikes, gardening more independently, .... They can also make more time for personal projects. Long term volunteers can also be engaged in the communication, website content, administration of the organisation, ... 

We have some vacancies for ESC volunteers: residents from Europe between 18 and 30 that stay for minimum 1 month. When you participate in this program, you get some pocket money and financing for your transport.

# ACCOMMODATION 
We have reconstructed a former barn. There's a spacey kitchen with a rocket stove, where life mostly goes on. If the 'polyvalent room' is not used for activities, it's available for volunteers. In summer, it's a cool, shady place that we also used for drying herbs. 
 
The accommodation is simple. Take into account that this kind of life takes a bit more time than in a house in the city. Compost toilets need to be emptied and sawdust supplies need to be filled. It takes more time to light a wood stove than it takes to turn on the gas. Vegetables need to be harvested and cleaned before you can start preparing dinner. Laundry needs to be hung, water kettles and hot water bottles need to be filled (winter) or hot water needs to be hauled in from the solar boiler in the next building, etc. 
If you want to try/share this kind of life for a while, this is your project. If not, it might be frustrating.

Food
Our food is:
- seasonal (so no cucumbers in April, eggs in December, or pumpkins in August), 
- local (so no coffee, chocolate, or peanut butter), 
- organic, 
- mostly vegetarian and low on milk products (but we have chickens for eggs and make some yogurt from milk of a local farmer).
- we cook on a woodstove

We mostly have unprocessed products. We buy some basics such as oil, grains and legumes and we grow fruit, veggies, and herbs. It’s up to volunteers to turn these into meals, bread spreads (jam, hummus, pesto, veggie pâté, etc.), and other tasty things like pickles or sauerkraut. We buy flour from a local mill using grain from local, organic farmers and bake sourdough bread with it.

Typically, there are oats and sourdough bread with home-made jam for breakfast at eight, soup or salad and bread with home-made spreads for lunch at twelve, fruit or smoothy in the afternoon, and a cooked vegetarian meal for diner around six. In the season, there are, of course, always fruits and berries to be picked from the land.

Washing
There’s an outdoor shower with hot (solar heated, so depending on availability) and cold water. Because the rainwater is limited, is should be used with care. In winter, water is heated on the stove, and you have to wash from a bucket.

Heating
All heating is done with home-made rocket-mass-wood stoves. Usually, only the kitchen is heated. The sleeping area is not. We have plenty of blankets and warm water bottles for wintertime.
The stove in the kitchen is heated once or twice per day for cooking and/or warmth. During this time it is possible to heat water for drinking and washing, which then can also be put into thermoses for later use. 
When it’s warm outside and the sun is shining the solar cooker and electricity can also be used to heat water.

Sleeping
We have some separate rooms and a dormitory for three. Beds, sheets, pillows and blankets are available. Volunteers can bring a tent. 

Transport
The place is easily reached with public transport. Every hour, a 10 min walk will take you to a bus stop, which will take you to a train station, which can take you directly to Brussels and Gent. Please don't come by car. There are some bikes, but they are only borrowed to longer term volunteers that are able to take care of them or want to learn that.

Other things
- We only invite non-smokers.
- There is wifi and a laptop.
- Compost toilets only.
